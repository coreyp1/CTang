/**
 * The contract these four honour is cutil's, not libc's, and it differs in
 * two places that a container built on the allocator is entitled to rely on:
 * a zero-size request yields a real pointer rather than a possible NULL, so
 * that NULL means failure and nothing else, and the product in a calloc() is
 * checked rather than assumed.  cutil's own default allocator states both; an
 * allocator that dropped them would be a subtly different one.
 *
 * They also keep one invariant that the default allocator does not need and
 * this library does: every live block has been counted exactly once as an
 * allocation, and is counted exactly once when it is released.  cutil's
 * counters do not maintain that by themselves - gcu_malloc() and gcu_calloc()
 * increment the allocation count, but gcu_realloc() increments nothing while
 * gcu_free() always increments, NULL included.  That is consistent for a
 * block that is malloc()ed, grown and freed, and wrong at both ends for the
 * way a cutil container actually allocates: GCU_Array obtains its storage by
 * calling realloc() against a NULL pointer and never calls malloc() at all,
 * so its buffer would be freed having never been counted, and gcu_array_
 * destroy() would then count a second free for the NULL data pointer that
 * gcu_array_steal() left behind.  Two spurious frees per array.
 *
 * The tests assert that allocations and frees balance around every program
 * run, so an allocator that let those through would report a leak that is not
 * there - or, worse, hide a real one behind the noise.

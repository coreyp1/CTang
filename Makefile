# The optimization level is the one thing that distinguishes the two builds'
# compile flags. `release` is what gets installed and what anything linking
# against this library actually runs, so it is compiled for speed; `debug` is
# compiled for stepping through. -g stays in both, because a release build that
# cannot be read in a debugger is a release build nobody can diagnose, and a JIT
# is worth having readable backtraces for; the symbols cost only file size, not
# run time, since -g emits DWARF rather than different code.
#
# BUILD=debug used to change only the artifact's *name* - it appended -debug to
# BRANCH and VERSION_STRING and nothing else - so `make BUILD=debug` produced a
# -O2 binary wearing a debug filename, which is the one build you cannot step
# through.
#
# Where the other -O levels in this file come from, since last-one-wins only
# helps if the flags actually arrive in that order:
#   - `make coverage` appends --coverage -O0 through EXTRA_CFLAGS, which is at
#     the end of CFLAGS, so its -O0 wins.
#   - The fuzz build does not use CFLAGS at all; FUZZ_LIB_FLAGS carries its own
#     -O1.
#   - The sanitizer build is the exception worth knowing about: SAN_FLAGS has no
#     -O of its own, and SAN_CFLAGS is $(CFLAGS) $(SAN_FLAGS), so `make
#     test-asan` runs at whatever OPT_CFLAGS says rather than at a level of its
#     own. That is why it follows BUILD along with everything else. Measured:
#
#       62 C   translation units at -O2   (the library, inheriting release)
#        7 C++ translation units at -O1   (the test binaries)
#
#     Seven of the nine libraries in the suite are shaped this way, so the
#     sanitizer gate's fidelity moves with the release level rather than being
#     pinned.
#
#     SETTLED for ctang on 2026-09-23: it stays inheriting. A sanitizer gate
#     built at a different -O than the shipped library is testing a different
#     program, so matching is the option that needs no argument and diverging
#     is the one that does. Inheriting also keeps `BUILD=debug` able to put the
#     gate at -O0 when a stack trace matters, which pinning would take away.
#
#     The argument that used to weigh against this was aliasing coverage. It
#     never worked, for a reason better than the one first written here: no
#     sanitizer sees this class at any -O. See below. This is ctang's decision
#     on ctang's evidence, not a suite-wide ruling; the other eight still have
#     to make it for themselves.
#
#     One cost of pinning that is easy to miss, measured here on gcc 14.2.0
#     rather than taken on report: -Wstrict-aliasing only fires when
#     -fstrict-aliasing is active, and gcc enables that at -O2, not before.
#     `gcc -O1 -Q --help=optimizers` prints [disabled] for it and -O2 prints
#     [enabled]. On a type-punning probe, -O1 alone found nothing, adding
#     -fstrict-aliasing to -O1 found it, and -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing found
#     nothing - the warning follows the flag rather than the level. So pinning
#     the sanitizer build at -O1 drops aliasing checking silently unless
#     -fstrict-aliasing is named alongside it.
#
#     The paragraph above is RIGHT and an earlier version of this block
#     briefly said otherwise. Level sensitivity is a property of the
#     construct, along two axes measured pairwise on gcc 14.2.0 at -O2:
#
#       *(int *)&g        address of a visible object, in place    1 2 3
#       int * p = ...&g   same object, via a pointer variable      1 2
#       *(int *)d         d is a parameter                         1
#       struct-to-struct  cast of a parameter                      1
#       through a void *                                           none
#
#     Taking the address of an object the compiler can see is what level 2
#     needs; routing the cast through a separate pointer variable is what
#     defeats level 3, which reports the in-place dereference and nothing
#     else. Level 1 dominates - it catches whatever any level catches.
#
#     So ctang's effective level 3 is a narrow instrument, not an absent one:
#     it fires on the first row under ctang's real flags and on none of the
#     rest. Four constructs probed here at first all sat on the same side of
#     both axes, which produced a clean and wrong "level 3 catches nothing".
#
#     Level 1 cannot be adopted regardless: building the library with it emits
#     669 diagnostics across 48 of the 62 translation units, every one of them
#     the C struct-inheritance downcast `(GTA_Ast_Node_Boolean *) self`, which
#     C17 6.7.2.1p15 makes well defined. That idiom IS the vtable mechanism
#     this library is built from, so they are not a backlog to work through.
#
#     None of which changes the decision above, because the aliasing argument
#     for matching the shipped -O never worked anyway: NO sanitizer detects
#     this class at ANY -O, so "the optimizer exploits aliasing at -O2,
#     therefore run the gate at -O2" is a true claim about the optimizer
#     welded to a false one about the gate. The gate stays inherited for the
#     reasons given above, not for this one.
#
#     And a green `make test CC=clang` is not evidence here either way: clang
#     accepts -Wstrict-aliasing=1 and =2, implements neither, and rejects =3.
#
#     Those figures are read out of the ARTIFACTS, not parsed out of `make -n`.
#     gcc records the command line in DWARF by default (-grecord-gcc-switches),
#     so the flags an object was actually built with are in the object:
#
#       readelf --debug-dump=info <file> | grep DW_AT_producer
#
#     and the level is the last -O in that string. The 7 test units have no .o
#     of their own - each test binary is compiled and linked in one step - so
#     for those, read the executable and keep the C++ compile units. Exclude
#     gcc's own libsanitizer CUs, which are in there too (asan_preinit.cpp and
#     friends, at -O2) and are not ours.
#
#     Four successive attempts to get this number by parsing `make -n` output
#     were each wrong in a different direction, so the text is not the
#     instrument. Recorded so nobody repeats them: counting every -O on a line
#     rather than the last invents compilations, since only the last is obeyed.
#     Selecting lines by ` -c ` drops every unit compiled and linked in one
#     step - here all 7 C++ units - and reports 62 as though it were the whole
#     gate, while the self-check still sums, because the dropped lines are
#     missing from both sides. Selecting instead on the line naming a source
#     over-matches in other libraries of the suite, roughly doubling their
#     counts, for a reason nobody has yet traced; it happens to be right here,
#     which is not a recommendation.

# -O2 rather than -O3: measured across five workloads and both execution paths,
# -O3 came out slower than -O2, and -O2 captured essentially the whole win over
# -O0 (6-9%).
#
# Treat that as a measurement of today's ctang rather than a finding about -O3.
# The library still has untraced inefficiencies, and a -O3-is-slower result on a
# codebase with unexplained overhead may be describing the overhead - -O3's
# extra inlining is exactly the kind of thing that could be interacting with it.
# Re-measure once those are traced; until then -O2 stands because it is the
# suite floor, not because -O3 was ruled out.
#
# It is tempting to discount that span on the grounds that a share of ctang's
# run time is JIT-emitted machine code no -O level recompiles. That reasoning
# was pre-registered as a prediction when the levels were measured, and it was
# wrong: fib(30) gained 20% under the JIT and 24% under bytecode, essentially
# the same. perf says why - only 9.85% of a JIT-executed fib(32) is in emitted
# instructions, while 48% is ctang's own C runtime and 35% is libc, because the
# JIT emits a call into that runtime for essentially every arithmetic operation
# and comparison. The JIT is native code calling C per operation, not a program
# running natively, so -O reaches almost all of it.
#
# What the figure really carries is the allocator: a third of fib's time is
# malloc, one computed value heap-allocated per integer result. That is the
# untraced inefficiency above, with a number on it - and it is a far better
# reason to distrust a -O3 comparison than the JIT is, since allocation
# behaviour is exactly what extra inlining perturbs. Fixing value reuse is

# Sanitizer build (ASan + UBSan)
####################################################################
#
# A second, separately-instrumented build of the whole library and every test.
# Five things here are deliberate, and each of them is a mistake some library
# in this suite has already made:
#
# 1. Its own build directory. Sanitizer objects and release objects must never
#    be linked together, and sharing $(OBJ_DIR) makes that a matter of which
#    target ran last.
#
# 2. Every compile writes a .d file and every one of them is included below.
#    Without that this build tracks source timestamps only: edit a header and
#    the objects including it are not rebuilt, so the run links objects
#    compiled against different versions of the same struct. compress hit
#    exactly this - one object sized a struct at 56 bytes and another at 64,
#    and ASan reported a heap-buffer-overflow in correct code. A sanitizer
#    build that can be assembled from mismatched objects is worse than none:
#    it can invent a failure and it can just as easily hide a real one.
#
# 3. float-cast-overflow is named explicitly. It is in *clang's*
#    -fsanitize=undefined group and NOT in GCC's, and -fno-sanitize-recover
#    names the same group, so it does not cover the check either. A gate that
#    says only "undefined" will print this class of bug and still exit 0.
#    Measured on gcc 14.2 by the model session; ctang has a live instance
#    (`x as int` for a large float), so this is not hypothetical here.
#
# 4. -fno-sanitize-recover at compile time, as well as halt_on_error=1 in the
#    environment. UBSan recovers by default: it prints the diagnostic, carries
#    on, and exits 0. The environment variable closes that too, but only for
#    runs that go through this target - the compile-time flag is what still
#    holds when someone runs one of these binaries by hand.
#
# 5. LD_PRELOAD names the ASan runtime. The runtime insists on being
#    initialised before anything it intercepts; any LD_PRELOAD inherited from
#    the environment loads ahead of it and it then refuses to start at all.
#    Desktop sessions here set LD_PRELOAD for unrelated reasons, so this is
#    not hypothetical either.
#
# There is deliberately no TSan target: ctang creates no threads (pthread_create
# appears in no source file), so a ThreadSanitizer run could not fail, and a
# gate that cannot fail is worse than an absent one because it reads as
# coverage. Add one with the first thread.

# Flag stamps
####################################################################
# Each build tree carries the flag string it was built with. The stamp is
# rewritten only when that string differs -- written to a scratch file,
# compared, moved into place only on a difference -- so its mtime moves on a
# flag change and on nothing else. The object rules above depend on it.
#
# This replaces listing `Makefile` as a prerequisite, which was too broad (a
# comment-only edit recompiled everything) and too narrow (a command-line
# override such as `make EXTRA_CFLAGS=-O2` changes no file's mtime and so was
# invisible).
#
# These rules sit at the end of the file for two reasons. A rule's target
# expands when make reads the line, so a stamp rule above its own OBJ_DIR
# definition has an empty target: not an error, just a rule that silently does
# not exist. And the first target in a makefile is the default goal, so a stamp
# rule above `all:` makes a bare `make` build the stamp and nothing else.
#
# Each stamp must name every variable its guarded recipes expand, the compiler
# included - a stamp that records a variable one derivation upstream of the
# real one passes every test you would think to run. Measured here before the
# fix: `make all CC='cc -O1'` rebuilt 0 of 62 objects and left every one of
# them recording -O2, because $(CC) appeared in every compile recipe and in no
# stamp. The same held for LIB_CFLAGS against CFLAGS, and for the fuzz tree's
# ICU_CFLAGS and CUTIL_CFLAGS, which come from pkg-config and so change when a
# dependency is reinstalled rather than when this file is edited.
#
# The check is mechanical: for each recipe a stamp guards, subtract the
# stamp's variables from the recipe's. Anything left is a flag change that
# rebuilds nothing, which is invisible - it looks exactly like a tree that was
# already current.

 *
 * Record the input a fuzz harness is about to run, so that a death nobody can
 * attribute still hands over its reproducer.
 *
 * libFuzzer writes a crash artifact from a callback that runs *after* the
 * sanitizer has finished reporting. When the sanitizer cannot finish - the
 * signature is
 *
 *     AddressSanitizer:DEADLYSIGNAL
 *     AddressSanitizer: nested bug in the same thread, aborting.
 *
 * meaning it hit a second fatal signal while reporting the first - that
 * callback never runs, and the input that caused it is gone. That happened
 * once here, at execution 2,038,515 of a parse run, and cost a long hunt with
 * nothing to reproduce from.
 *
 * The fix is to write the input down before running it, into a file mapped
 * MAP_SHARED. The kernel writes a shared mapping back whether or not the
 * process exits cleanly, so the record survives any death short of losing
 * power - verified against SIGKILL, which leaves the last input intact.
 *
 * It costs one memcpy per execution and no syscall, so it does not distort
 * exec/s, and it is on by default deliberately: the whole difficulty with a
 * one-in-millions crash is that you cannot switch on the instrument
 * afterwards. Set LAST_INPUT_FILE to move it, or to /dev/null to disable.
 *
 * Read one back with:
 *   python3 -c "import struct,sys; d=open(sys.argv[1],'rb').read(); \
 *     n,s=struct.unpack_from('<QI',d,0); sys.stdout.buffer.write(d[12:12+s])" \
 *     build/last-input-parse.bin > repro.tang

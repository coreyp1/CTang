/**
 * @file
 *
 * An LD_PRELOAD shim that makes every executable mapping fail.
 *
 * The JIT asks mmap() for one PROT_EXEC page per compiled program, and the
 * arm that handles being refused is not reachable from any input: the test
 * suite compiles thousands of programs and every one of them is granted its
 * page. Preloading this makes the refusal the only outcome, so that the
 * suite runs the failure arm for every program it compiles.
 *
 * Only PROT_EXEC mappings are refused. malloc(), the C++ runtime and ICU all
 * map memory without it and are handed the real mmap(), so the process runs
 * normally in every respect except that no program can be JIT compiled.
 *
 * Linux only, and a test artifact: it is never installed.
